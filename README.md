# COMPLEX NUMBERS OPERATIONS
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
#
#
## OUESTION:
Design a class ‘Complex ‘with data members for real and imaginary part.
Provide default and parameterized constructors. Write a program to
perform Arithmetic operations of two complex numbers using operator
overloading. Addition and subtraction using friend functions.
#
#
## OUTPUT: (ADDITION - SUBTRACTION)
```

Enter First Complex Number
Real Part : 12
Imaginary Part : 8
Entered Number is : 12+8i

Enter Second Complex Number
Real Part : 5
Imaginary Part : 6
Entered Number is : 5+6i
